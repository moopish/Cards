CARDS

  These classes are related to dealing with cards and decks of cards

  Card

    This class represents a card. Cannot be instantiated outside of this package.
  Cards are setup such that all possible cards are stored within a single array and
  those cards are shuffled into decks. Only one instance of a particular card
  exists.

  Deck

    This is an abstract class that store information on a deck. To get a deck a call
  must be made to createDeck() or createDeck(int). These methods will get on of the
  two following:

    FiniteDeck : A deck where each card is limited to be drawn x times where x is the
                number of 52 card decks used. Each card of the deck must be used
                before x+1 of that card can be drawn.

    InfiniteDeck : Any card can be drawn with equal probability for each draw.
